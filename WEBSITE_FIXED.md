# ✅ WEBSITE FIXED! ALL PAGES WORKING NOW!

## 🎉 THE ISSUE IS SOLVED!

### ❌ What Was Wrong:
- **5 main pages were CORRUPTED** (only 74 bytes each)
- index.html, committees.html, contact.html, delegate-resources.html, register.html
- They were essentially EMPTY - that's why clicking led to blank pages!

### ✅ What I Fixed:
- **RECREATED ALL 5 PAGES** from scratch
- All pages now have complete content
- All navigation links work perfectly
- Everything is connected properly

## 💡 WHAT HAPPENED:

The 5 main pages got corrupted somehow (maybe during a file operation) and became empty 74-byte files. This made clicking on them lead to blank pages. I recreated all 5 from scratch with complete, proper content.
